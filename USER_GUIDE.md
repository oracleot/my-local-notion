## Getting Started

When you first open the app, you'll see an empty workspace with a sidebar on the left. The sidebar shows "No pages yet" and a **+** button to create your first page.

![Empty state](docs/screenshots/01-empty-state.png)

---

## Creating Pages

Click the **+** button next to "Pages" in the sidebar. A dropdown menu appears with two options:

- **Document** — A rich-text page for notes, writing, and general content
- **Board** — A kanban board with columns and cards for task management

![New page menu](docs/screenshots/02-new-page-menu.png)

Select one to create your page. You'll be taken to it immediately.

---

## Writing Documents

The document editor is a full-featured block editor. Click into the page title at the top to name your page, then click the editor area below to start writing.

| Image / Video   | Embedded media with captions         |

![Slash commands menu](docs/screenshots/03-slash-commands.png)

### Text Formatting

Select text to reveal a formatting toolbar with options for **bold**, *italic*, underline, strikethrough, code, and links. You can also use standard keyboard shortcuts:

- **Bold** — `⌘+B`
- **Italic** — `⌘+I`
- **Underline** — `⌘+U`

---

## Using Icons

Every page can have an emoji icon. Hover over the area above the title and click **Add icon** to open the icon picker. Click any emoji to set it as the page icon.

![Icon picker](docs/screenshots/05-icon-picker.png)

The icon appears next to the page title and in the sidebar for easy identification.

![Page with icon](docs/screenshots/06-document-with-icon.png)

To change an existing icon, click it and select a new one from the picker.

---

## Kanban Boards

Kanban boards help you organize tasks in columns. When you create a **Board** page, it comes with three default columns: **To Do**, **In Progress**, and **Done**.

![Kanban board](docs/screenshots/07-kanban-board.png)

### Adding Cards

Click **+ Add card** at the bottom of any column. Type a title and press **Enter** or click **Add** to create the card.

### Moving Cards

Drag and drop cards between columns or reorder them within a column using the grip handle on the left side of each card.

### Adding Columns

Click **+ Add column** on the right side of the board to add new columns. You can rename or delete columns via the **⋯** menu in each column header.

---

## Editing Cards

Click on any card to open the detail dialog. Here you can:

- Edit the card **title**
- Add or update a **description**
- **Delete** the card using the red Delete button
- Click **Save** or press **Enter** to save changes

![Card detail dialog](docs/screenshots/08-card-detail.png)

---

## Subtasks

Subtasks help you break down complex cards into smaller, manageable pieces. Any card on a kanban board can have subtasks.

### Adding Subtasks

Click on any card to open its detail dialog. In the **Subtasks** section, click **+ Add** to create a new subtask.

![Add subtask form](docs/screenshots/16-add-subtask-form.png)

Type the subtask title and press **Enter** or click **Add** to create it. Subtasks are added to the same column as the parent card initially.

### Viewing Subtasks

The parent card's detail dialog shows all its subtasks in a list. Each subtask displays:

- A **status circle** — empty for incomplete, filled for complete
- The **subtask title**
- The **current column** the subtask is in (e.g., "To Do", "In Progress", "Done")

![Card detail with subtasks](docs/screenshots/15-card-detail-subtasks.png)

Click any subtask in the list to open its detail dialog.

### Subtasks on the Board

Subtasks appear as separate cards on the kanban board, just like regular cards. They can be:

- **Dragged** between columns independently of their parent
- **Identified** by a small label showing the parent card's title

The parent card displays a **progress badge** (e.g., "0/3 done") showing how many subtasks are complete.

![Kanban board with subtasks](docs/screenshots/17-kanban-with-subtasks.png)

### Subtask Details

Click a subtask card to open its detail dialog. Subtask dialogs show:

- A **Parent** link at the top — click to navigate to the parent card
- The usual **Title** and **Description** fields
- A **Promote** button to convert the subtask into a standalone card

![Subtask detail dialog](docs/screenshots/18-subtask-detail.png)

### Promoting Subtasks

If a subtask grows in scope and should become its own card, click the **Promote** button in the subtask's detail dialog. This removes the parent relationship, turning it into a regular standalone card.

### Key Points

- Subtasks can **move independently** between columns
- A subtask is marked **complete** when moved to the last column (typically "Done")
- Subtasks are **one level only** — subtasks cannot have their own subtasks
- **Deleting a parent card** also deletes all its subtasks

---

## Nested Pages & Breadcrumbs

You can create sub-pages under any existing page. Hover over a page in the sidebar and click the **+** button, then choose **Document** or **Board**.

Sub-pages appear nested under their parent in the sidebar tree. A breadcrumb trail appears at the top of each sub-page showing the full path from root to current page. Click any breadcrumb to navigate to that ancestor page.

![Breadcrumbs navigation](docs/screenshots/14-breadcrumbs.png)

Click the **chevron arrow** (›) next to a parent page in the sidebar to expand or collapse its children.

---

## Sidebar Navigation

The sidebar is your central hub for navigating pages:

- **Click** a page name to navigate to it
- **Hover** over a page to reveal action buttons:
  - **+** — Add a sub-page (Document or Board)
  - **⋯** — Open the context menu with Rename and Delete options

![Context menu](docs/screenshots/09-context-menu.png)

### Collapsing the Sidebar

Click the **collapse icon** (⊟) in the top-right corner of the sidebar to hide it and gain more editor space. Click the **expand icon** to bring it back. You can also press **`⌘+\`** to toggle the sidebar.

![Sidebar collapsed](docs/screenshots/13-sidebar-collapsed.png)

---

## Search

Press **`⌘+K`** anywhere in the app to open the search dialog. All your pages appear in a searchable list. Type to filter by page name, then press **Enter** or click a result to navigate directly to that page.

![Search dialog](docs/screenshots/10-search-dialog.png)

The search shows each page's icon and type (Document or Kanban) for easy identification.

---

## Dark Mode

The app supports light and dark themes. Click the **theme toggle** button in the top-right corner of the main content area to switch between modes. The theme cycles through:

1. **Light** (☀️) — Light background
2. **Dark** (🌙) — Dark background
3. **System** (🖥️) — Follows your operating system preference

### Dark Mode — Kanban Board

![Dark mode kanban](docs/screenshots/11-dark-mode-kanban.png)

### Dark Mode — Document Editor

![Dark mode editor](docs/screenshots/12-dark-mode-editor.png)

Your theme preference is saved and persists across browser sessions.

## Export & Import

Sync your workspace across devices using a single JSON file. No accounts, no cloud services — just export on one device and import on another.

### Opening the Export / Import Dialog

1. Click **Settings** at the bottom of the sidebar
2. Select **Import / Export** from the menu

![Settings menu](docs/screenshots/19-settings-menu.png)

### Exporting Your Workspace

In the Export / Import dialog, click **Export Workspace** to download a `my-notebook-YYYY-MM-DD.json` file.

![Export / Import dialog](docs/screenshots/20-export-import-dialog.png)

Alternatively, press **`⌘+Shift+E`** anywhere in the app for a quick export (downloads immediately without opening the dialog).

The export file contains all your pages, kanban boards, cards, and subtasks.

### Importing & Merging

1. Open the Import / Export dialog from **Settings** in the sidebar
2. Drag and drop your exported JSON file onto the drop zone, or click to browse
3. The app **merges** the imported data with your existing data

### How Merge Works

- **Newer changes win**: If the same page or card exists in both places, the one with the more recent `updatedAt` timestamp is kept
- **Nothing is lost**: Items that exist only in the import file are added; items that exist only locally are preserved
- **Edit beats delete**: If you edited something on one device and deleted it on another, the edit is preserved (safer default)
- **Deletions sync**: Items you deleted are tracked, so they won't reappear when you import from an older backup

After import, a summary shows how many pages/cards were added, updated, or deleted.

### Sync Workflow

For ongoing sync between devices (e.g., laptop and desktop):

1. **Export** from Device A and save the file to a cloud-synced folder (iCloud Drive, Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive)
2. **Import** the file on Device B
3. **Export** from Device B back to the same cloud folder
4. **Import** on Device A when ready

This bidirectional workflow keeps both devices in sync without needing a server.

## Data & Privacy

- **All data is stored locally** in your browser using IndexedDB. Nothing is sent to any server.
- **No account needed** — just open the app and start writing.
- Data persists between browser sessions and page reloads.
- **Back up your data** using the built-in **Export** feature (Settings → Import / Export, or press `⌘+Shift+E`).
- **Clearing browser data** (cookies + site data) will permanently delete your notebook pages. Export regularly to avoid data loss.

> **Tip:** The app requests persistent storage from the browser on first load to prevent your data from being automatically cleaned up.
